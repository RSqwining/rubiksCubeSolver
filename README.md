# RubixSolverx86

Rubix cube solver written in x86 assembly for masm. The project uses the Irvine32 library and 32 bit programming. This project was written for CMPE 102 final project by myself and Harjot Singh. The final output is a text file that shows the moves necessary to solve the cube in standard notation using only clockwise rotations and assuming the yellow face is up and the blue side is facing the solver.
